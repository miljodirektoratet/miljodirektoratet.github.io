* Posts are written in markdown, if you don't know it, don't worry, there's not much to it. [See this post by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/){:target="_blank"} to learn some of the basics.

That's about all you need to know to get started.

### Lets create a new blog post

1. Navigate to the `_posts` folder on GitHub
2. Click `Add file` > `Create new file`
3. Name your file `{{ site.time | date: '%Y-%m-%d' }}-your-new-blog-post.md`
4. Set the title of your blog post by using a markdown header
  * Write this as the first line `## This is my first blog post`
5. Add some content...write some random things, whatever you want
6. Throw in a code block (code blocks are created by surrounding your code snippet with three backticks at each end and an optional "language hint"), copy paste this in:
    ````plaintext
    ```tsql
    SELECT *
    FROM sys.tables
    WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
    ```
    ````
  * **Important note**, if you're using T-SQL code, make sure to use the `tsql` tag. This will tell your site that you want to use the SSMS style formatting.
